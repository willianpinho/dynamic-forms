## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

This main repository contains:
- Shared configurations and documentation
- JSON schemas for dynamic forms (`200-form.json`, `all-fields.json`)
- Git submodules for native implementations with independent architectures

### Submodules

- `dynamic-forms-android/` - **Kotlin/Jetpack Compose** (Production Ready) - [Repository](https://github.com/willianpinho/dynamic-forms-android)
- `dynamic-forms-ios/` - **Swift/SwiftUI** (Production Ready) - [Repository](https://github.com/willianpinho/dynamic-forms-ios)

## Working with Submodules

### Initial Clone

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/willianpinho/dynamic-forms.git
```

### Clone without submodules (then initialize)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/willianpinho/dynamic-forms.git
cd dynamic-forms
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

### Update submodules

```bash
git submodule update --remote
```

### Working on a submodule

```bash
cd dynamic-forms-android  # or dynamic-forms-ios
# Make changes, commits, etc.
# The submodule is an independent Git repository
```

### Update submodule reference in main project

```bash
# After making commits in the submodule
git add dynamic-forms-android  # or dynamic-forms-ios
git commit -m "Update Android submodule to latest version"
```
